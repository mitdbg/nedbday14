                        <p style="color: red; font-size: 70%;"> There are many
                          web applications that require users to coordinate and
                          communicate. Friends want to coordinate travel plans,
                          students want to jointly enroll in the same set of
                          courses, and busy professionals want to coordinate
                          their schedules. These tasks are difficult to program
                          using existing abstractions provided by database
                          systems since they all require some type of
                          coordination between users. However, this type of
                          information flow is fundamentally incompatible with
                          classical isolation in database transactions. In this
                          talk, I will argue that it is time to look beyond
                          isolation towards principled and elegant abstractions
                          that allow for communication and coordination between
                          some notion of (suitably generalized) transactions.
                          This new area of declarative data-driven coordination
                          is motivated by many novel applications and is full of
                          challenging research problems. This talk describes
                          joint work with Gabriel Bender, Nitin Gupta, Christoph
                          Koch, Lucja Kot, Milos Nikolic, and Sudip Roy. </p>

                      <div id="12" style="display: none;">
                        <p style="color: red; font-size: 70%;"> A data curator
                          is an integrated system for managing heterogeneous
                          collections of data sources. Such collections are
                          valuable to analysts, but they are often expensive to
                          construct because of several common challenges. These
                          include cleaning and transforming individual sources,
                          semantic discovery and integration between sources,
                          and de-duplication within composites. While there has
                          been much research on the various components of
                          curation, e.g., integration and de-duplication, there
                          has been little work on uniting them in an integrated
                          system. In addition, most of the previous work will
                          not scale to the sizes of problems that we are finding
                          in the field. For example, one web aggregator
                          (Goby.com) requires the curation of 80,000 URLs. A
                          second company, in biotech (Novartis), has the problem
                          of curating 8,000 spreadsheets. At this scale,
                          curation cannot be done manually, i.e., by humans, but
                          must entail a combination of machine learning
                          approaches with human assistance when necessary. This
                          talk will describe Data Tamer, a curation system we
                          have built at M.I.T. It subjects a collection of data
                          sources to machine learning algorithms to perform
                          attribute identification, grouping of attributes into
                          tables, transformation of incoming data, and
                          de-duplication. When data is updated and new sources
                          are added, the target collection is incrementally
                          reanalyzed. At any time, a human can intervene to give
                          guidance. Data Tamer includes a data visualization
                          system (Wrangler) so a human can examine a data source
                          and specify transformations. We have run Data Tamer on
                          the Goby.com data and it lowers curation costs by
                          about 90\%. Similar results have been observed on the
                          Novartis data. Besides a description of the system, we
                          will perform a Data Tamer demo. </p>

                          growing, real, and urgent demand for energy-efficient
                          database processing. Fueled in part, by the impending
                          end of multi-core scaling‚Äôs ability to sustain Moore‚Äôs
                          Law due to energy inefficiency, hardware design -ers
                          are increasingly exposing different power/performance
                          trade-off mechanisms to higher-level software systems.
                          Since data processing tasks typically have acceptable
                          levels of performance, such as acceptable query
                          latency, data processing systems have a great
                          opportunity to exploit these hardware
                          power/performance mechanisms to decrease energy
                          consumption. The focus of this presentation is on the
                          design and evaluation of a general framework for query
                          optimization that considers both performance
                          constraints and energy consumption as first-class
                          optimization criteria. Our experimental evaluations
                          show that our system-wide energy savings can be
                          significant and point toward greater opportunities
                          with upcoming energy-aware technologies on the
                          horizon.</p>

                        <p style="color: red; font-size: 70%;"> Complex networks
                          such as human social groups, transportation networks
                          and the World Wide Web are frequently represented as
                          graphs. Crucial aspects of a dynamic network, like the
                          variation of shortest distance between points of
                          interest, can be discovered by processing a collection
                          of graphs that represent the network at different
                          times. Applications which can benefit from such
                          analysis include national security, sociopolitical
                          studies, economics, healthcare and transportation. We
                          present a new system, G*, that is uniquely suited to
                          the applications mentioned above. G* can efficiently
                          store collections of large graphs within a server
                          cluster without duplicating the commonalities between
                          these graphs. In contrast to traditional database
                          management systems and graph processing systems, G*
                          provides a declarative language that can succinctly
                          express sophisticated queries on multiple graphs. G*
                          executes a query using a network of operators that
                          process, in parallel, the distributed graph data and
                          produce the query result. To speed up queries on
                          multiple graphs, G* processes each graph vertex and
                          its edges only once and shares the result across all
                          of the relevant graphs. G* also provides a set of
                          processing primitives that abstract away the
                          complexity of distributed data management, thereby
                          allowing the simple implementation of parallel graph
                          processing operators. Our evaluation shows that G*
                          significantly outperforms both traditional database
                          systems and state-of-the-art graph processing systems
                          at storing and processing multiple graphs while
                          achieving a high degree of scalability. This talk will
                          include a brief demonstration of the current G*
                          system.</p>

                          environments where large volumes of data require a
                          management by exception approach to business
                          operations. StreamBase LiveView combines techniques
                          from complex event processing (CEP), active databases,
                          online analytic processing (OLAP) and data warehousing
                          to create a live data warehouse against which
                          continuous queries are executed. The resulting system
                          enables users to make ad hoc queries against tens of
                          millions of live updating records, and receive
                          push-based updates when the results of their queries
                          change. This system is used for operational and risk
                          monitoring in high frequency trading environments,
                          where conditional alerting and automated remediation
                          enable a handful of operators to manage millions of
                          transactions per day, and make the results of trading
                          visible to hundreds of customers in real-time. </p>

                          for WYSIWYG editing of the visualizer/editor.
                          Historically, users have been limited to the data
                          schemas, visualizations, and interactions offered by a
                          small number of heavyweight applications. In contrast,
                          Dido encourages and enables the end user toedit (not
                          code) in his or her web browser a distinct ephemeral

                          rapidly becomes the universal standard for scalable
                          data analysis and processing, it is increasingly
                          important to understand its strengths and weaknesses
                          in order to optimize for efficiency in its numerous
                          application scenarios. For example, Hadoop can be used
                          for processing unstructured data, semi-structured
                          data, relational data, and even graph data. Although
                          there is plenty of room to improve the performance of
                          Hadoop on any of these types of data, Hadoop‚Äôs
                          performance on relational data and graph data is
                          particularly far from optimal. In this talk, Daniel
                          Abadi will describe the design of Hadapt, which
                          improves Hadoop‚Äôs performance on relational data by a

                        <p style="color: red; font-size: 70%;"> Hadoop has
                          become an attractive platform for large-scale data
                          analytics. In this paper, we identify a major
                          performance bottleneck of Hadoop: its lack of ability
                          to colocate related data on the same set of nodes. To
                          overcome this bottleneck, we introduce CoHadoop, a
                          lightweight extension of Hadoop that allows
                          applications to control where data are stored. In
                          contrast to previous approaches, CoHadoop retains the
                          flexibility of Hadoop in that it does not require
                          users to convert their data to a certain format (e.g.,
                          a relational database or a specific file format).
                          Instead, applications give hints to CoHadoop that some
                          set of files are related and may be processed jointly;
                          CoHadoop then tries to colocate these files for
                          improved efficiency. Our approach is designed such
                          that the strong fault tolerance properties of Hadoop
                          are retained. Colocation can be used to improve the
                          efficiency of many operations, including indexing,
                          grouping, aggregation, columnar storage, joins, and
                          sessionization. We conducted a detailed study of joins
                          and sessionization in the context of log
                          processing---a common use case for Hadoop---, and
                          propose efficient map-only algorithms that exploit
                          colocated data partitions. In our experiments, we
                          observed that CoHadoop outperforms both plain Hadoop
                          and previous work. In particular, our approach not
                          only performs better than repartition-based
                          algorithms, but also outperforms map-only algorithms
                          that do exploit data partitioning but not colocation.</p>

                          a fast database management system (DBMS) just by
                          storing all of their data in main memory. The real
                          challenge is in how one makes such systems go even
                          faster and scale to support the demands of modern
                          web-scale on-line transaction processing (OLTP)
                          applications. Many of the so-called NoSQL systems are
                          simply not an option for applications that are unable
                          to relax their ACID requirements. Thus, a new emerging
                          class of parallel main memory DBMSs are designed to
                          take advantage of these application's partitionable
                          workloads while maintaining traditional DBMS
                          guarantees. But because storage I/O is no longer the
                          bottleneck in a diskless environment, new challenges
                          arise that often cannot be overcome just by adding
                          more hardware. This talk will discuss our research in
                          improving the performance of systems that are already
                          fast to begin with. The first part of the talk will
                          discuss techniques for automatically partitioning a
                          main memory, shared-nothing database such that it
                          maximizes the number of single-partition transactions.
                          In the second part, we will present a novel approach
                          for dynamically selecting the proper transaction
                          optimizations at run time. Such optimizations are
                          applied both before a transaction begins to execute
                          (e.g., reduced concurrency control), as well as while
                          it executes (e.g., query pre-fetching and speculative
                          execution). </p>

                          applications are nearly ubiquitous, especially as a
                          building block for web-based applications. One
                          challenge with such applications is that for
                          transactional workloads that do many small accesses to
                          the database, they waste resources and increase
                          latency by incurring many separate round trips (one
                          per SQL statement) to access the database. A well
                          known technique to improve transactional database
                          application performance is to convert part of the
                          application into stored procedures that are executed
                          on the database server. Unfortunately, this requires
                          re-coding parts of application as stored procedures,
                          and having a detailed understanding of the parts of
                          the program that are good to push into the database
                          (e.g., those that reduce communication). Often this
                          can be difficult even for experts because, for
                          example, the database server might already be loaded
                          by other applications, and pushing any additional code
                          into it would actually slow down execution rather than
                          speed up. In general, developers frequently have no
                          idea about the amount of resources that are available
                          on the server that hosts their applications, thus
                          making it even more difficult to write
                          performance-aware programs. To address this challenge,
                          we are building Pyxis, a system that takes
                          database-backed applications and automatically
                          partitions their code into two pieces, one of which is
                          executed on the application server, and the other on
                          the database server. Pyxis first profiles the
                          application and server loads, and produces a
                          partitioning using the program dependence graph that
                          minimizes the number of control transfers and the
                          amount of data sent during each transfer. Our initial
                          experiments using TPCC shows that Pyxis is able to
                          generate partitions with 50% less latency and the same
                          throughput when compared to a traditional jdbc-based
                          implementation, and has comparable performance with a
                          custom stored procedure implementation.</p>

                        <p style="color: red; font-size: 70%;"> A promising
                          usage of Flash solid-state drives (SSDs) in a DBMS is
                          to extend the buffer pool. Most existing work on SSD
                          buffer-pool extension does not utilize the
                          non-volatile feature of the SSD, and therefore suffers
                          from long peak-to-peak interval. To reuse the data
                          cached in the SSD buffer pool after a restart, it is
                          important to make the SSD buffer table persistent. An
                          existing approach achieved this by storing the SSD
                          buffer table as a memory-mapped file. But this
                          ‚Äúquick-fix‚Äù results in lower sustained performance,
                          because every update in the SSD buffer table may lead
                          to an I/O. In this paper we propose two new designs.
                          One design reconstructs the SSD buffer table through
                          the transactional log. The other design asynchronously
                          flushes the SSD buffer table, and upon a restart,
                          lazily verifies the integrity of the data cached in
                          the SSD buffer pool. We implemented the three designs
                          in SQL Server. For each design, both a write-through
                          method and a write-back method were implemented. We
                          ran experiments using a variety of benchmarks, and
                          show the tradeoffs of the design alternatives. The
                          pitfalls that we discovered are revealed.</p>

                          in-memory key-value data store for SMP machines. Data
                          resides in memory in a kind of Blink - tree [3].
                          Persistence is ensured through concurrent logs and
                          checkpoints. The key to Scotch‚Äôs performance is
                          reducing DRAM stalls and managing memory caches.
                          Scotch combines latch-free (lock-free) lookup, via
                          read-copy-update techniques [4, 6], with local
                          latching on updates. On a 16-core machine, with remote
                          clients accessing the tree via the network, Scotch can
                          achieve up to 2.7 Mops/s on VoltDB‚Äôs ‚Äúvolt2‚Äù benchmark
                          [2] (small keys and values), about 20x more than a
                          best-performing VoltDB deployment on the same
                          hardware. (VoltDB of course supports more features
                          than Scotch, but we disabled many features, including
                          replication.) With logging disabled, Scotch achieves
                          4.3 Mops/s. Without the network and logging
                          components, Scotch‚Äôs tree can currently achieve 21
                          Mops/s for lookups on some benchmarks. Nevertheless,
                          the network and logging components are not the only
                          bottleneck‚Äîtree design matters even in the context of
                          a full system. A version of Scotch using a balanced
                          binary tree has half Scotch‚Äôs throughput on our
                          benchmarks.</p>

                          need to analyze past states to detect trends and
                          anomalies so they can exploit opportunities and
                          prevent disasters. Today, support for programs that
                          analyze past states (retrospection) is available in
                          some fully-featured commercial relational databases
                          but it is not available for many applications that
                          consider a fully-featured SQL-based relational
                          database to be too heavy-weight. Instead, these
                          applications rely on a growing list of simpler
                          light-weight and mid-tier databases such as Berkeley
                          DB, SQLite and MongoDB, to name just a few.
                          Light-weight databases typically provide no support
                          for retrospection, requiring application developers to
                          roll their own. Without adequate support, it is hard
                          for application developers to reconstruct the
                          consistent states corresponding to the past events of
                          interest. A key reason for this unfortunate situation
                          is that up to now there was no way to add efficient
                          support for retrospection in a database, without
                          extensive, prohibitively costly modifications to
                          database internals. We have invented a new way to add
                          efficient support for retrospection in a transactional
                          database. A key feature of our approach, called Retro,
                          is that its implementation requires only modest
                          modification to the database internals. The modest
                          scope of the modification provides important software
                          engineering and performance benefits. Retro can be
                          easily implemented in a high-performance transactional
                          database while inheriting the database's
                          highly-engineered performance characteristics.</p>
