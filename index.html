<p>Wehad previously planned to offer dinner, but due to the overwhelminginterest in the event, the logistics of planning dinner became too
complex.
<p>--> </p>
            <p> We would be happy to recommend restaurants at any price level to
              attendees who are interested in eating in Cambridge or Boston

            <h2>Registration</h2>
	    This year we will be charging non-students a nominal fee ($25) to defray some of our costs and discourage registrants who are not serious about attending (so that we can better plan for food and 
drink allocation.)  If this cost is prohibitive to you and you are a non-student, please contact
us.  Click <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4563158530">here</a> for our registration site.
            <h2>Technical Program</h2>
            The program will consist of two keynote talks, a number of short
            (20-30 minute) presentations from you, the participants, and a
            poster session! Details about the program <a href="program.html">are now available</a>.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>
            <p> </p>
            <h2> Poster and Paper Submission </h2>
            We are no longer accepting paper or poster submissions.

<h2> Parking and Transportation </h2>
            We cannot provide on-campus parking for all attendees. If you are
            coming from the North or West, you may find it most convenient to
            drive to Alewife Station and take the Red Line to Kendall Square
            (MIT is about 2 blocks from the Kendall Square Station, which is on
            Main St.) If you are coming from the South, you can park at
            Braintree or Quincy Station and take the Red Line as well. See this
            <a href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/?route=RED">Red
Line
              Map</a>. Parking at these stations is $7.00.
            <p>If you are driving to MIT, there are several nearby pay parking
              lots. See MIT's page listing <a href="http://web.mit.edu/facilities/transportation/parking/visitors/public_parking.html">public
parking
                facilities</a>. The Cambridge Center lots are all a short walk
              to the Stata Center. Most lots charge $20.00 for one day parking.
